# Contributing to GHCL

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

It's people like you that make the Open Source model work. So thank you for being awesome!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

GitHub Contibution Leaderboard (GHCL) is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into GHCL itself.

## Your first contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to GHCL? You can start by looking through these

* [good first issue](https://github.com/javatarz/github-contribution-leaderboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
* [help-wanted issues](https://github.com/javatarz/github-contribution-leaderboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first 😸

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
